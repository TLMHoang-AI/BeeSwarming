There are 2 datasets buzz 1 and buzz 2, where we evaluate performance on both to increase the generalization of our models
This project mainly conducted experiments on two datasets with two distinct scenarios: SB1 (Swarming Bee sound 1) and SB2 (Swarming Bee sound 2), containing audio recordings of bee activity, capturing variations in acoustic patterns associated with swarm behavior.  Overall, SB1 challenges the generalization ability, while SB2 focuses on diverse training data to improve the comprehensiveness of the model itself. Table 1 presents a detailed overview of the dataset, including the distribution of samples across training, testing, and validation sets for both Swarming and Non-Swarming categories. The dataset is divided into two subsets, SB1 and SB2, each recorded at different sampling rates of 16000 Hz and 32000 Hz, respectively.
The SB1 is designed to test the model's generalization capability by completely separating the training, testing, and validation data based on 3 main factors: data collection time, location, and swarming state. This ensures that the model will always encounter unseen data in the testing and validation phases, creating a challenge to test its robustness in handling real-world scenarios.
The SB2, in another way, emphasized diversity within the training set by collecting samples on different days and across various recording devices. This approach aims to capture the extensive range of non-swarming bee behavior, increasing in model's adaptability. by maintaining the independence of training, testing, and validation set. SB2 guarantees an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.
