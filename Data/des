there are 2 dataset buzz 1 and buzz 2, where we evaluate performance on both to increase generalization of our models

This project mainly conducted experiments on two datasets with two distinct scenario: SB1 (Swarming Bee sound 1) and SB2 (Swarming Bee sound 2), containing audio recordings of bee activity, capturing variations in acoustic patterns associated with swarm behavior.  Overall, SB1 challenges the generalization ability, while SB2 focuses on diverse training data to improve the comprehensiveness of the model itself. Table 1 presents a detailed overview of the dataset, including the distribution of samples across training, testing, and validation sets for both Swarming and Non-Swarming categories. The dataset is divided into two subsets, SB1 and SB2, each recorded at different sampling rates of 16000 Hz and 32000 Hz, respectively.
